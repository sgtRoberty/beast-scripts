# SCRIPT:      make_beastMCMC_jobs.sh
# AUTHOR:      Robert Haobo Yuan
# DATE:        2025-10-14
#
# DESCRIPTION:
# This script makes replicate folders for a BEAST2 MCMC analysis based on an existing XML file and SLURM submission (SH) script in the current directory.
# It copies and renames the XML and SH files into each replicate folder, adjusting the job name and XML filename in the SH file accordingly.
# The user should adjust the submission details (time, memory, etc.) in the SLURM submission script as needed before running this script.
# Ensure that only one .xml and one submit*.sh file are present in the directory.
#
# USAGE:
# ./make_beastMCMC_jobs.sh <number_of_replicates> [starting_run_number]
#
